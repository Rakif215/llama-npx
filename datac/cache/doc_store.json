The QFCA, the QFC Regulatory Authority, the Court and Tribunal are \\r\\nindependent of each other and the Government of Qatar. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe  QFC  Regulatory  Authority,  the  independent  regulatory  body,  regulates  licenses  and  supervises \\r\\nfinancial services and other firms that conduct activities in, or from, the Qatar Financial Centre.

After  adjusting  for  the  movement  in \\r\\nappropriations received in advance and appropriations receivable of USD 8,927 thousand (2022: USD \\r\\n7,469 thousand), USD 45,623 thousand was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for \\r\\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 (2022: USD 42,227 thousand). \\r\\n \\r\\nAs per Article 14 of Qatar Financial Centre Law No. 7 of 2005, the QFC Regulatory Authority has the \\r\\nright to retain any excess appropriations provided by the Government; these appropriations have been \\r\\ntreated as part of retained surplus. \\r\\n \\r\\n3.

The QFC Regulatory Authority recognises \\r\\nlease  liabilities  to  make lease  payments  and  right-of-use  assets  representing  the  right  to  use  the \\r\\nunderlying assets. \\r\\n \\r\\ni) Right-of-use assets   \\r\\n \\r\\nThe QFC Regulatory Authority recognises right-of-use assets at the commencement date of the lease \\r\\n(i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less \\r\\nany  accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and  adjusted for any remeasurement of lease \\r\\nliabilities.  The cost of right-of-use assets  includes  the amount of lease  liabilities recognised, initial \\r\\ndirect costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease \\r\\nincentives received. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the \\r\\nlease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:  \\r\\n \\r\\nOffice space                           3 years \\r\\nOffice equipment                     3 years  \\r\\nVehicles                      3 years \\r\\n \\r\\nIf ownership of the leased asset transfers to the QFC Regulatory Authority at the end of the lease term \\r\\nor the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated \\r\\nuseful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. \\r\\n \\r\\nii) Lease liabilities  \\r\\n \\r\\nAt  the  commencement  date  of  the  lease,  the  QFC  Regulatory  Authority  recognises  lease  liabilities \\r\\nmeasured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments \\r\\ninclude fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, \\r\\nvariable  lease payments that depend  on an index  or a rate,  and  amounts expected to be  paid under \\r\\nresidual  value  guarantees.  Variable  lease  payments  that  do  not  depend  on  an  index  or  a  rate  are \\r\\nrecognised as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the \\r\\nevent or condition that triggers the payment occurs. \\r\\n \\r\\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the QFC Regulatory Authority uses its incremental \\r\\nborrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not \\r\\nreadily  determinable.  After  the  commencement  date,  the  amount  of  lease  liabilities  is  increased  to \\r\\nreflect the  accretion of interest and  reduced for the  lease  payments made. In addition, the  carrying \\r\\namount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change \\r\\nin the lease payments (e.g., changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate \\r\\nused to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the \\r\\nunderlying asset.  \\r\\n \\r\\niii) Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets  \\r\\n \\r\\nThe QFC Regulatory Authority applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to its short-term \\r\\nleases(i.e., those leases that have lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do \\r\\nnot contain a purchase option). It also applies the lease of low-value assets recognition exemption to \\r\\nthe lease that is considered of low value (i.e., below USD 5,000). Lease payment on short-term leases \\r\\nand leases of low-value assets are recognised as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"Vf7zS82G7/M7iyCNSN7oR0AXQDwGzwzVKSHEOF7JvPU=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf_15":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf_15\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":15,\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/llama-npx/datac/data/Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nQATAR FINANCIAL CENTRE REGULATORY AUTHORITY \\r\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\r\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 \\r\\n \\r\\n- 10 - \\r\\n3.

If  any  indication  exists,  or  when  annual  impairment  testing  for  an  asset  is \\r\\nrequired,  the  QFC  Regulatory  Authority  estimates  the  asset’s  recoverable  amount.  An  asset’s \\r\\nrecoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is \\r\\ndetermined  for  an  individual  asset,  unless the  asset  does  not  generate  cash  inflows  that  are  largely \\r\\nindependent of those from other assets or group of assets.  \\r\\n \\r\\nFinancial assets \\r\\n \\r\\nClassification \\r\\n \\r\\nThe QFC Regulatory Authority classifies its financial assets in the following measurement category: \\r\\n \\r\\n• those to be measured at amortised cost \\r\\n \\r\\nThe classification is based on two criteria: \\r\\n \\r\\n- The QFC Regulatory Authority’s business model for managing the assets; and \\r\\n- Whether the instruments’ contractual cash flows represent “solely payments of principal and \\r\\ninterest (profit) on the principal amount outstanding (the ‘SPPI criterion’)”. \\r\\n \\r\\nRecognition and measurement  \\r\\n \\r\\nFinancial assets are classified, at initial recognition, as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair \\r\\nvalue  through  other  comprehensive  income  (OCI),  and  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss.  The \\r\\nclassification of financial assets at initial recognition depends on the financial asset’s contractual cash \\r\\nflow characteristics and the QFC Regulatory Authority’s business model for managing them. The QFC \\r\\nRegulatory Authority initially measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial \\r\\nasset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs. \\r\\n \\r\\nDe-recognition \\r\\n \\r\\nA financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial \\r\\nassets) is primarily de-recognised when:  \\r\\n \\r\\n• The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or \\r\\n• The QFC Regulatory Authority has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or \\r\\nhas assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third \\r\\nparty  under  a “pass-through” arrangement;  and  either  (a)  the QFC Regulatory  Authority has \\r\\ntransferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the QFC Regulatory Authority \\r\\nhas  neither transferred  nor  retained  substantially all  the  risks and  rewards  of the  asset,  but  has \\r\\ntransferred control of the asset \\r\\n \\r\\nImpairment of financial assets \\r\\n \\r\\nThe QFC Regulatory Authority recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all debt \\r\\ninstruments. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance \\r\\nwith  the  contract  and all  the  cash  flows  that  the  QFC  Regulatory  Authority  expects  to  receive, \\r\\ndiscounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.

When  an  existing  financial  liability  is  replaced  by  another  from  the  same lender  on \\r\\nsubstantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an \\r\\nexchange or modification is treated as the de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition \\r\\nof a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of \\r\\ncomprehensive income. \\r\\n \\r\\nCash and cash equivalents \\r\\n \\r\\nCash and cash equivalents comprise bank balances and deposits with banks held for the purpose of \\r\\nmeeting  short-term  cash  commitments  that  are  readily  convertible  to  a  known  amount  of  cash  and \\r\\nsubject to insignificant risk of changes in value. \\r\\n \\r\\nFor the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and \\r\\nshort-term deposits with a maturity of up to twelve months or less. \\r\\n \\r\\nProvisions \\r\\n \\r\\nProvisions are recognised when (a) the QFC Regulatory Authority has a present obligation (legal or \\r\\nconstructive) as  a  result  of  a  past  event, (b) it  is  probable  that  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying \\r\\neconomic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and (c) a reliable estimate can be made of \\r\\nthe amount of the obligation. When the QFC Regulatory Authority expects some or all of a provision \\r\\nto  be  reimbursed,  the  reimbursement  is  recognised  as  a  separate  asset,  but  only  when  the \\r\\nreimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the statement of \\r\\ncomprehensive income net of any reimbursement.  \\r\\n \\r\\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax \\r\\nrate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the \\r\\nincrease in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. \\r\\n \\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"poykKs0h0Uw72Mp+AAZ+xXQiGrw+RSeGs34g91YJ9Iw=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf_17":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf_17\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":17,\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/llama-npx/datac/data/Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nQATAR FINANCIAL CENTRE REGULATORY AUTHORITY \\r\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\r\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 \\r\\n \\r\\n- 12 - \\r\\n3.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT \\r\\n  \\r\\nThe QFC Regulatory Authority’s financial liabilities comprise accounts payable and lease liabilities. \\r\\nThe main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the QFC Regulatory Authority’s operations \\r\\nand to provide guarantees to support its operations.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED) \\r\\n \\r\\nMarket risk \\r\\n \\r\\nMarket  risk  is  the  risk  that  changes  in  market  prices,  such  as  interest  rates  and  foreign  currency \\r\\nexchange  rates, will  affect  the  profit  or  the  value  of the QFC Regulatory Authority’s holdings  of \\r\\nfinancial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control the market \\r\\nrisk exposure within acceptable parameters, while optimising return. \\r\\n \\r\\nInterest rate risk \\r\\n \\r\\nInterest  rate  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  a financial  instrument  will \\r\\nfluctuate  due  to changes in market interest rates. The QFC Regulatory Authority is  not exposed  to \\r\\ninterest rate risk on its interest-bearing assets (bank deposits) as the interest rate on bank deposits is \\r\\nfixed. The statement of comprehensive income and equity is not sensitive to the effect of reasonable \\r\\npossible  changes  in  interest  rates,  with  all  other  variables  held  constant,  as  the  QFC  Regulatory \\r\\nAuthority does not hold any floating rate financial assets or financial liabilities at the reporting date. \\r\\n \\r\\nCurrency risk \\r\\n \\r\\nCurrency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate \\r\\ndue to changes in foreign exchange rates. The QFC Regulatory Authority’s principal business is \\r\\nconducted  in  United  States  Dollars and  Qatari  Riyals.  As  the  Qatari  Riyal  is  pegged  to the  United \\r\\nStates Dollar, there is considered to be minimal currency risk. \\r\\n \\r\\nCredit risk \\r\\n \\r\\nCredit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other \\r\\nparty  by  failing  to  discharge  its  obligation.

SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS \\r\\n \\r\\nThe preparation of the QFC Regulatory Authority’s financial statements requires management to make \\r\\njudgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts recognised in the financial \\r\\nstatements and certain disclosures. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could \\r\\nresult  in  outcomes  that  could  require  a  material  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amount  of  the  asset  or \\r\\nliability affected in future periods. \\r\\n \\r\\nThe  key  assumptions  concerning  the  future  and  other  key  sources  of  estimation  uncertainty  at  the \\r\\nreporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of \\r\\nassets and liabilities within the next financial year are described below. \\r\\n \\r\\nUseful lives of furniture and equipment and Rights of Use assets \\r\\n \\r\\nThe QFC Regulatory Authority’s management determines the estimated useful lives of its furniture \\r\\nand equipment for calculating depreciation. The estimate is determined after considering the expected \\r\\nusage of the asset or physical wear and tear. Management reviews the residual value and useful lives \\r\\nannually; future depreciation charge is adjusted where the management believes the useful lives differ \\r\\nfrom previous estimates. \\r\\n \\r\\nUseful lives of intangible assets  \\r\\n \\r\\nThe QFC Regulatory Authority’s management determines the estimated useful lives of its intangible \\r\\nassets with finite lifetime for calculating amortisation. The estimate is determined after considering \\r\\nthe  expected  usage of the  intangible  asset  or technological  obsolescence.  Management reviews the \\r\\nuseful lives annually; future amortisation charge is adjusted where the management believes the useful \\r\\nlives differ from previous estimates. \\r\\n \\r\\nDetermining the lease term \\r\\n \\r\\nIn  determining  the  lease  term,  management  considers  all  facts  and  circumstances  that  create  an \\r\\neconomic incentive to exercise an extension option, or not exercise a termination option. Extension \\r\\noptions  (or  periods  after  termination  options)  are  only  included  in  the  lease  term  if  the  lease  is \\r\\nreasonably certain to be extended (or not terminated). Potential future cash outflows have not been \\r\\nincluded in the lease liability because it is not reasonably certain that the leases will be extended (or \\r\\nnot terminated).  \\r\\n \\r\\nThe assessment is reviewed if a significant event or a significant change in circumstances occurs which \\r\\naffects this assessment and that is within the control of the lessee.  \\r\\n \\r\\nLeases - estimating the incremental borrowing rate \\r\\n \\r\\nThe QFC Regulatory  Authority cannot  readily  determine  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  the  lease, \\r\\ntherefore, it uses its incremental borrowing rate (IBR) to measure lease liabilities. The IBR is the rate \\r\\nof interest that the QFC Regulatory Authority would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and \\r\\nwith a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an  asset of a similar value to the right-of-use \\r\\nasset  in  a  similar  economic  environment.  The  IBR  therefore  reflects  what  the QFC  Regulatory \\r\\nAuthority ‘‘would have to pay’’, which requires estimation when no observable rates are available. \\r\\nThe QFC Regulatory Authority estimates  the  IBR using observable inputs (such as market interest \\r\\nrates) when available and is required to make certain entity-specific estimates. \\r\\n \\r\\nCalculation of loss allowance  \\r\\n \\r\\nWhen  measuring  ECL, the Regulatory  Authority uses  reasonable  and  supportable forward-looking \\r\\ninformation, which is based on assumptions for the future movement of different economic drivers \\r\\nand  how  these  drivers  will  affect  each other.  The Regulatory  Authority uses  estimates  for  the \\r\\ncomputation of loss rates. \\r\\n\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"DOCUMENT\",\"hash\":\"HRo9LSguVeJU3V9xUowK0338j7WQ/xu3eMVQM9ULJdw=\"}","__type__":"DOCUMENT"},"./data/Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf_28":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"./data/Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf_28\",\"metadata\":{\"page_number\":28,\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/llama-npx/datac/data/Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA) - FS December 2023 - Final Issued.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{},\"text\":\"\\r\\nQATAR FINANCIAL CENTRE REGULATORY AUTHORITY \\r\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \\r\\nFor the year ended December 31, 2023 \\r\\n \\r\\n- 23 - \\r\\n18.

Useful lives of furniture and equipment and Rights of Use assets \\r\\n \\r\\nThe QFC Regulatory Authority’s management determines the estimated useful lives of its furniture \\r\\nand equipment for calculating depreciation. The estimate is determined after considering the expected \\r\\nusage of the asset or physical wear and tear.

Useful lives of intangible assets  \\r\\n \\r\\nThe QFC Regulatory Authority’s management determines the estimated useful lives of its intangible \\r\\nassets with finite lifetime for calculating amortisation. The estimate is determined after considering \\r\\nthe  expected  usage of the  intangible  asset  or technological  obsolescence.
